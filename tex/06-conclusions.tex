\section{Conclusions and further work}

The original goal of running PenPoint OS on modern hardware was met by using
the SDK distribution of PenPoint and installing it on FreeDOS in VirtualBox:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        It is possible to run PenPoint on any computer that can run VirtualBox
    \item
        The performance of this solution is excellent
    \item
        It is possible to use a graphics tablet or a touch screen as a pointing
        device
\end{itemize}

Potential improvements include modifying source code of QEMU so that absolute
pointing methods work with it correctly, and porting the changes to JPC
emulator created by professor Schubiger to either VirtualBox or QEMU to run the
PenPoint OS version for NCR System 3125 - the flagship PenPoint device - with
all of its bells and whistles.
