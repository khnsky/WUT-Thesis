\section{Running PenPointOS on FreeDOS}

In this second part I will explain what FreeDOS and PenPointOS SDK are, and how
to install and run the PenPointOS version intended for developers. Using this
version of PenPoint OS was made possible after one of the commenters on
professor Schubiger original PenPointOS video found the installation media
files hosted on a site dedicated to archiving computer history.

In these following sections I will outline the steps to installing the
PenPointOS version for MS-DOS, and running on QEMU in FreeDOS.

\subsection{PenPoint for DOS}

The creators of PenPointOS knew that users would not choose their operating
system over an established solution, even if it was a better product, had there
not been software written for it. That is why making the barrier to entry for
developers as low as possible, and making them productive as fast as possible
was one of the goals Robert Carr, the architect of PenPoint, outlined as a key
requirement in the book ``The Power of PenPoint'' \cite{carr1991}. The creators
also knew that programmers would not be able or eager to invest in new devices.
That is why the PenPointOS Software Development Kit included a version of
PenPointOS that could be installed on compatible desktop PCs running MS-DOS.

\subsection{What is FreeDOS}

FreeDOS is a free and libre open source operating system licensed under GPL. It
is intended to be fully compatible with MS-DOS environment and is designed to
run well in a virtual machine. FreeDOS has a thriving community. There is
original development of new software, and there programs ported from other
platforms. And everything is well documented.  FreeDOS is easier to use and
much more accessible than the original DOS.  There is even a package manager.
All of those reasons make it a good pick to use for the purposes of running
PenPoint OS.

\subsection{Obtaining the files}

After downloading the files from the bitsavers website the eight floppy disk
images need to be converted in order for them to be used. The .IMD files were
created using a DOS program ImageDisk used to backup floppies. These however
cannot be used with QEMU as the format is not supported. In order for them to
be readable to QEMU these must be converted to .img files. This can be done
using any program that supports converting .IMD files to .img files.

\subsection{Installing PenPointOS on FreeDOS}

After installing FreeDOS in a virtual machine and converting the ImageDisk
files to .img, now it is the time to install PenPoint OS. In order to do so
a floppy device must be added to the VM configuration. Here the file DISK1.img
must be used as source. Inside FreeDOS inserted floppy will be available as A:
drive. To access another drive simply type its name. Finally to run the
installation execute install.exe \ref{fig:fd-main-screen}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fd-main-screen.png}
    \caption{FreeDOS: main screen}
    \label{fig:fd-main-screen}
\end{figure}

Then get through the installation wizard by confirming to use the C: drive for
installation and the installation subdirectory \ref{fig:penpoint-installation}.
The default choices are fine.  After installation from the first floppy is
finished the wizard will ask to insert the next disk until the contents of all
eight disks are installed.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{penpoint-installation-1.png}
        %\caption{PenPoint OS installation}
        %\label{fig:penpoint-installation-1}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{penpoint-installation-2.png}
        %\caption{PenPoint OS installation}
        %\label{fig:penpoint-instsallation-2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{FreeDOS: PenPoint OS install wizard}
    \label{fig:penpoint-installation}
\end{figure}

Just before the installation wizard closes it informs that additional user
configuration will be required before running PenPointOS will be possible. It
tries to create or modify an existing \emph{CONFIG.SYS} file with a directive
\emph{FILES=20} and creates a new file called AUTOEXEC.NEW that has to be
incorporated into an existing \emph{AUTOEXEC.BAT} file
\ref{fig:penpoint-installation-2}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{penpoint-installation-3.png}
        %\caption{PenPoint OS installation}
        %\label{fig:penpoint-installation-3}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{penpoint-installation-4.png}
        %\caption{PenPoint OS installation}
        %\label{fig:penpoint-instsallation-4}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{FreeDOS: PenPoint OS installation, config changes}
    \label{fig:penpoint-installation-2}
\end{figure}

FreeDOS actually by default uses \emph{FDCONF.SYS} and \emph{FDAUTO.BAT} files
instead. The config file is a special file that is run during startup and has
a special set of commands that can be run during boot. The \emph{FILES=20}
command sets the maximum number of file descriptors to 20. This is unnecessary
because default \emph{FDCONF.SYS} already uses a value of 40. The autoexec file
is a regular batch file that is automatically run after startup. The contents
of the \emph{AUTOEXEC.NEW} file are simply commands setting the environmental
variables used by PenPoint with paths from installation. These can be just
copied at the top of the \emph{FDAUTO.BAT} \ref{fig:fd-config}. It might be
useful to remember not to overwrite the \emph{PATH} variable but instead to
prepend the PenPoint value so that executables bundled with FreeDOS can still
be found.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fd-config.png}
    \caption{FreeDOS: FDAUTO.BAT config file}
    \label{fig:fd-config}
\end{figure}

Now we can try running PenPoint.

\subsection{Running PenPointOS}

%Now that the installation is complete to run PenPoint a script
%\emph{\\
%\textbackslash{}PENPOINT\textbackslash{}SDK\textbackslash{}UTIL\\
%\textbackslash{}DOS\textbackslash{}GO.BAT\\
%} \\
Now that the installation is complete to run PenPoint a script

\Verb[fontshape=it]|\PENPOINT\SDK\UTIL\DOS\GO.BAT|

\noindent
should be used. Here however we encounter the first problem. PenPoint does not
start, instead it crashes with a JemmEx exception \ref{fig:jemmex}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{jemmex.png}
    \caption{FreeDOS: JemmEx exception}
    \label{fig:jemmex}
\end{figure}

After trying a few things it turns out that this issue does not occur if FreeDOS
was booted in safe mode - one of the booting options defined in
\emph{FDCONF.SYS}. As it turns out JemmEx is in fact not loaded this way.
JemmEx is an Expanded Memory Manager. Expanded Memory was a workaround for 8088
and 8086 CPUs that allowed using the Upper Memory, that is between 640K and 1M
to address memory beyond 1M. Extended Memory on the other hand refers to memory
beyond the 1M on 286 and newer processors which could address this memory
normally. PenPointOS does not support Expanded Memory and only works on Extended
Memory \cite{godevtools}.

Now after removing loading JemmEx from startup PenPointOS starts. However there
is another problem. After some loading a broken pen and a number 1000 appears,
and the initialisation hangs \ref{fig:broken-pen}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{broken-pen.png}
    \caption{PenPoint OS: broken pen error 1000}
    \label{fig:broken-pen}
\end{figure}

The error 1000 according to the ``Pen Point Development Tools'' book means that
no pointing device was enabled in the \emph{MIL.INI} file \cite{godevtools}.
After uncommenting the line that enables PS2 mouse support in \emph{MIL.INI}
\ref{fig:mil-ini}, PenPointOS boots correctly \ref{fig:penpoint-mainscreen}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\linewidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{mil-ini.png}
        \caption{FreeDOS: MIL.INI}
        \label{fig:mil-ini}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill

        \caption{PenPoint OS: main screen}
        \label{fig:penpoint-mainscreen}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{booted PenPoint OS}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Using a graphics tablet to point}

Now PenPoint is running and working correctly with a mouse.  Unfortunately just
because a mouse is working does not mean that other pointing devices will work
as well.  For example a mouse and a graphics tablet used with a finger work
without issue, but using a stylus is unwieldy.  Instead of moving with the pen
on the tablet, the pointer behaves more like a joystick - when the stylus is in
the middle of the tablet the pointer is stationary but when stylus is moved off
centre then the pointer moves in that direction, and the farther the stylus is
from the centre the faster it moves.  All of this happens because a mouse or
a finger movement on a tablet is a relative movement - the mouse moves by some
distance in a direction then the pointer should also move by that distance in
that direction, a stylus or a touchscreen, on the other hand, use absolute
movement - the stylus touches one corner of the tablet, the pointer should be
moved to the coroner of the screen.  The PS2 mouse emulation QEMU provides does
not have this functionality.

%QEMU also provides a graphics tablet emulation but it is a USB HID device that
%has to be initialised by the operating system. Simply adding a case handling an
%absolute movement to the PS2 mouse code, similar to the one in the source of
%the HID device, makes the mouse stop working altogether. It would probably have
%to keep a state where the pointer is and calculate the delta from there.

%At this point in time it is impossible to get rid of this issue without a big
%time investment. 

%Fortunately u
Using both a mouse and a tablet works out of the box in a different
virtual machine program: VirtualBox. VirtualBox follows a more plug-and-play
philosophy at a cost of being generally slower than QEMU. It has much less
configuration options, is less optimised and does not provide support for such
functionality as using devices directly with passthrough. The developers of
VirtualBox have put an effort into it working without the need for much
configuration instead.% The incurred speed penalty from using VirtualBox and not
%QEMU to run PenPoint is not perceivable if it is there at all.

\section{Making tablet and stylus work in FreeDOS in QEMU}

% hid nie działa bo nie ma go kto zainicializować
% in the following section...

QEMU supports using tablet as a pointing device but it does not work in FreeDOS
because QEMU only provides a generic Human Interface Device (HID) driver.  The
USB-HID specification is a standard that allows for many different input and
output devices to communicate with the computer without any additional software.
For the QEMU HID device to work however it must be initialised by the operating
system.  DOS obviously came long before HID standard was created, and so it is
not supported by FreeDOS.

In this section I will describe the process of making the tablet behave as the
pointing device in the expected way inside FreeDOS on QEMU.

\subsection{Creating testing environment}

% używanie qemu bez trzymanki trudne

QEMU is extremely feature rich.  This is a great advantage, however it makes
using, tuning configuring it pretty cumbersome, especially since QEMU by itself
only provides console arguments as a way to specify settings.

\subsubsection{libvirt}

% co to libvirt, virsh, virt-manager

Libvirt is a collection of software whose goal is to provide simple, continent
and unified way to manage virtualisation functionality such as virtual machines
and hypervisors, but also containers and network interfaces.  The pieces of
software that make up libvirt are a stable C API, a libvirtd daemon, and
a command line client virsh.

But virsh is not the only client.  The way libvirt operates anyone can use the
API to communicate with the daemon in their client.  Apart from virsh GOME
provides its own libvirt client - GOME Boxes - that matches the rest of their
environment, and there also exist an add-on to cockpit - the web-based server
administration tool.  I used virt-manager.

Here comes the problem however: although virt-manager proved to be great for
configuring amounts of memory, number of cores and adding peripherals, it does
not allow a way to change the path of the used QEMU executable, and overwriting
an executable provided and managed by the distribution's package manager is
something that could lead to serious issues.

\subsubsection{Using virsh}

% virsh dump cmd: zrzut
% virsh edit: zrzut
% sprawdzanie logów: zrzut

My first thought was to somehow find out the exact way that virt-manager
executes the QEMU binary, that is the command line parameters and maybe the
environment.  It turns out that every guest configuration is stored in xml
format in something called the domain.  It also turns out that the virsh command
line libvirt client has the ability to convert that xml to equivalent shell
invocation.

\begin{codeblock}
    \dots
    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={},
        language=bash,
        linerange={7-15},
        deletekeywords={local,wait},
    ]{virsh-domxml-to-native.sh}
    \dots
    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={},
        language=bash,
        linerange={29-36},
        deletekeywords={local,wait},
    ]{virsh-domxml-to-native.sh}
    \dots
    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={\lstinline|virsh domxml-to-native qemu-argv --domain PenPointOS|},
        language=bash,
        linerange={56-59},
        deletekeywords={local,wait},
    ]{virsh-domxml-to-native.sh}
\end{codeblock}

This however still did not work.  At the very least many of the paths for files
and directories that it used for example in the \lstinline{/var/lib/libvirt} are
dynamically created at runtime.  I tried copying them and adjusting the startup
script accordingly but it still would not cooperate.  This clearly was not the
right approach.

How about modifying the domain xml directly?  Fortunately virsh allows to do
this using the \emph{edit} command.

\begin{codeblock}
    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={},
        language=XML,
        linerange={1-16},
    ]{virsh-dumpxml.xml}

    \dots

    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={\lstinline|virsh edit PenPointOS|},
        language=XML,
        linerange={123-123},
    ]{virsh-dumpxml.xml}
\end{codeblock}

\noindent
Especially interesting is the line containing the \emph{emulator} tag.

\begin{codeblock}
    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={},
        language=XML,
        linerange={35-36},
    ]{virsh-dumpxml.xml}
    
    \dots

    \lstinputlisting[
        caption={\lstinline|virsh edit PenPointOS|},
        language=XML,
        linerange={122-123},
    ]{virsh-dumpxml.xml}
\end{codeblock}

\noindent
According to libvirt documentation \cite{libvirt} the \emph{emulator} element
specifies the fully qualified path to the emulator binary.

With this knowledge I was able to clone the QEMU virtual machine which had
FreeDOS with PenPoint SDK installed and change the binary that was used for
emulation to the one supplied by me.  This way I could have two virtual machines
that differed only in the QEMU binary they used which was useful as
a comparison.

\subsection{Building QEMU} %?

% info z aur
% configure
% make depends
% brak spice-protocol

When using QEMU in conjunction with other tools like libvirt it is important
that it is built with all the required functionality.  QEMU uses
a \emph{configure} script to determine local build environment characteristic.
One way to increase the build speed is to configure the build environment to
only compile the x86 system target.

\begin{codeblock}
    \begin{lstlisting}[
        caption={configure},
        language=bash,
        numbers=none,
        deletekeywords={enable},
    ]
        ../configure \
            --target-list=x86_64-softmmu \
            --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var \
            --libexecdir=/usr/lib/qemu --smbd=/usr/bin/smbd \
            --enable-modules --enable-sdl --disable-werror
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{codeblock}

The \emph{virsh edit} command verifies correctness of the modified domain
configuration.  In my case it was able to detect that the newly built QEMU
binary was missing support for SPICE which virt-manager used for display and
input to that virtual machine.  A good way to find out how QEMU must be
configured and its dependencies is to inspect how a package for specified system
is built.  On Arch Linux one can easily read \emph{PKGBUILD} - a file describing
the build process - for \emph{qemu-git} on Arch User Repository.

\subsection{Changes to QEMU source code}

% możliwość użycia tabletu w ppos, brak dokumentów itp.
% użycie ps2 do emulowania myszy
% opis ps2?
% centrum jest ui/input.c
%   w jaki sposób przekazuje info, skąd bierze, skąd wiadomo czy abs czy rel
% w moim przypadku dostaje info z ui/spice
% kod ps2

Although PenPoint supports multiple tablet devices, and even provides an option
to define a communication protocol for unsupported one \cite{godevtools}, I was
not able to find any information about graphical tablets from that time, much
less technical documentation that would be needed to create emulated version.

This however is not necessary.  Instead of creating a new device, a device that
is already present in QEMU and whose protocol is well supported - the PS/2
mouse.  That is how Synaptic touchpad worked: when Synaptic drives that
supported absolute mode were not present the touchpad identified itself as
a mouse and used either PS/2, Serial or Apple Desktop Bus protocols
\cite{synapticsinterfacing}.
